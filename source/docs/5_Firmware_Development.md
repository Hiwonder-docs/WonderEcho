# 5. Firmware Development

## 5.1 Voice Chip Firmware Development

### 5.1.1 WonderEcho Website Function

The WonderEcho website offers users a convenient way to customize the built-in wake word and commands for the WonderEcho voice interaction module. The website features two main sections: Language Model Development and Text-to-Speech. Users can submit common phrases to generate files for both the Language Model and Text-to-Speech. Once the files are generated, they can be downloaded, integrated into a bin file, and flashed onto the WonderEcho module to enable voice interaction capabilities.

### 5.1.2 Model Development

(1) Access the official firmware development platform: [https://www.wonderecho.net/](https://www.wonderecho.net)

(2) Before creating the firmware, click **"Sign in"** at the top right corner to register an account and log in.

(4) Click **"New Program"** in the top left corner to create a new project.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(5) In the **"Program Name"** field, enter a project name of your choice. For example, we use **"WonderEcho"**.

(6) To add command words, you have two options:

*   **Edit directly on the panel:** Click **"Add Row"** to manually input command words. Ensure all words are in **uppercase** and separate multiple words with hyphens (**-**).

*   **Upload a sample file:** Click **"Attachment Example"** to download a template. Edit the file in Excel according to the format, then upload it. The system will automatically process the data.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) We opt for the first methodâ€”direct editing. Click **"Add Row"** to add a wake-up command. Ensure the command is written entirely in **uppercase**, and use hyphens (**-**) to separate multiple words. Finally, set the command type to **"wake-up"**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(8) Similarly, add two more command words for recognition, setting their types to **"command"**. Once done, click **"Submit"** to complete the setup.

(9) Wait for the platform to process the model. After processing, click **"Download"** on the right to save the model to your local device.

(10) Next, click **"Text To Speech"** to create the broadcast voice prompts.

(11) Click **"New Program"** in the top left corner to create a new project for speech synthesis.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image11.png" class="common_img" />

(12) Choose a voice type for playback, such as **"Mia-English female voice"**, and set the volume to the default value of **15**.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image12.png" class="common_img" />

(13) Add three broadcast statements corresponding to the command words created in **"Language Model Development"**. In the **"Audio"** column, input the response for each command. For example, if the command **"HELLO-HI-WONDER"** is recognized, enter **"I am here"** as the response. Click **"Submit"** once completed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image13.png" class="common_img" />

(14) Wait for the platform to process the text-to-speech data. After processing, click **"Download"** on the right to save the audio files to your local device.

### 5.1.3 Integrate Language Model

(1) Extract the files starting with **"lm"** from the **"Language Model Development"** folder that you downloaded.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image15.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Copy the **\[60000\]{cmd_info}.xlsx** file from the **"CmdWordStructure"** folder to the [Firmware Development Tool\CI130X_SDK_Offline_uart_1_12_16\projects\cwsl_A_sample\firmware\user_file\cmd_info](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efqsA95PbBs_dRr-BbNYG_BOKanbrx51?usp=sharing) folder.

(3) Copy the file **\[0\]asr_english_CI1302_V00916.dat** from the **"GfstCmd"** folder and paste it into: [Firmware Development Tool\CI130X_SDK_Offline_uart_1_12_16\projects\cwsl_A_sample\firmware\asr](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efqsA95PbBs_dRr-BbNYG_BOKanbrx51?usp=sharing).

(4) Copy the file **\[1\]asr_english_CI1302_V00916.dat** from the **"GfstWake"** folder and paste it into: [Firmware Development Tool\CI130X_SDK_Offline_uart_1_12_16\projects\cwsl_A_sample\firmware\asr](****) folder.

### 5.1.4 Integrate Text To Speech

(1) Extract the file starting with **"tts"** from the **"Text To Speech"** download.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_5/image16.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Copy all audio files (`*.wav`) to the folder: [CI130X_SDK_Offline_uart_1_12_16\projects\cwsl_A_sample\firmware\voice\src](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efqsA95PbBs_dRr-BbNYG_BOKanbrx51?usp=sharing)

### 5.1.5 Firmware Integration

Open the [Firmware Development Tool\CI130X_SDK_Offline_uart_1_12_16\projects\cwsl_A_sample\firmware\Combine bin.bat](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efqsA95PbBs_dRr-BbNYG_BOKanbrx51?usp=sharing) file and wait for the firmware integration to complete. The window will automatically close once the process is finished.
